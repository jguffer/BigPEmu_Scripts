Cheap and dirty, sloppy, inefficient implementation of search scripts.
Have to edit the .py files directly to point to directory holding memory dumps which are to be searched.
Have to edit the .py files directly to specify number of data size in bytes, and to specify whether increasing/decreasing search.
Python dependencies were kept at minimum, on purpose, so no need to install/unstand libraries such as numpy.
